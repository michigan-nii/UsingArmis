# Introduction

Armis and Flux are the current (as of 28 March, 2019) main clusters at Michigan.

They share the same software.

Armis is for _HIPAA aligned_ data.  Note that is _aligned_ not _compliant_ or
some other word.  There are components of following HIPAA guidelines that are
part of the Armis configuration, but most of what HIPAA recommends governs your
behavior, what you do and don't do with the data.  You should review what your
responsibilities are with respect to HIPAA data.  In particular, make sure you
know what conditions must be met if you copy _any_data from a HIPAA regulated
project to any computer or other device that you, personally, own.

That said, once the data is on Armis, it behaves mostly the same way Flux does.
You can, therefore, use the Flux documentation as a guide, with appropriate
substitutions.
